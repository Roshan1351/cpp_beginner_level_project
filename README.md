##  Getting Started

These programs were tested on the GNU C++ compiler (`g++`) on Linux/macOS. They should also work on Windows with tools like MinGW or Visual Studio.

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`, `clang++`, MSVC)

### Compilation

To compile a specific program:

```bash
# Replace <ProgramName> with the specific filename (no spaces)
g++ "<ProgramName>.cpp" -o <ProgramName>
